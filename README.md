## Features

### 1. User Authentication

-   **View Post Details**: Users can click on any post to view its full content on a separate page. If logged in, users can comment on the post and see other users' comments. If not logged in, they will see the message "You must be logged in to comment."
-   **Edit and Delete Post**: From the `/my-posts` page, users can click on any of their posts to view, edit, or delete the post.

### 3. Comments

-   **Commenting**: Logged-in users can comment on any post. Users can also delete their comments if needed.
-   **Comment Management**: Post authors can see all comments on their posts from the `/my-posts` page and manage them accordingly.

### 4. Search Functionality

-   **Search**: Users can search for posts on both the `/posts` and `/my-posts` pages.

-   **Not Found Handler**: Handles all requests to non-existent routes and sends a response with a 404 status code and error message.
-   **Validation Errors**: Handles validation errors and sends a response with a 400 status code and error message.
-   **Authentication Errors**: Handles authentication errors and sends a response with a 401 status code and error message.
-   **MongoDB Errors**: Handles MongoDB errors and sends a response with a 500 status code and error message.
